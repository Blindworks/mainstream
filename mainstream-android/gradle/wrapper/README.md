# Gradle Wrapper

The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file will be automatically downloaded by Android Studio when you first sync the project.

If you're using the command line, you can download it by running:

```bash
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.4
```

Or simply open the project in Android Studio and click "Sync Project with Gradle Files".
